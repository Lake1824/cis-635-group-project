# cis-635-group-project

## Project Description

The project is a python application that allows users to calculate COCOMO II estimates for software projects. The
application will take in user input for the project size, cost drivers, and scale factors. The application will then
calculate the effort, schedule, and cost estimates for the project. The application will also provide a detailed
breakdown of the calculations and the intermediate values used in the calculations.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python 3 from the
official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Tkinter is also required to run the application. You can install tkinter by running the following command in the terminal:

```
brew install python3-tk
```

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can run the application by executing the following command in the terminal:

```
python front.py
```

This will open the application window where you can input the project details and calculate the COCOMO II estimates.
